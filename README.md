### Node DNSDumpster API
---
This little web scrapper was inspired by ([
API-dnsdumpster.com](https://github.com/PaulSec/API-dnsdumpster.com)).

After needing the information provided by [DNSdumpster.com](https://dnsdumpster.com/) I turned to the python solution that was already done and published, but because Node JS is used in the project am working on I decided to make a node package of my own to answer my needs.

Please feel free to use this, hope it will help others as it did me.
